3. L298N module
4. 4 DC motors
5. 4 AA batteries
6. 9V baterry
7. USB dongle for debugging (for STM32)

### Hardware application

First you need to connect the RC car according to the schematic found in the documents folder (docs).
After that, you need to install the Android Application given below:
